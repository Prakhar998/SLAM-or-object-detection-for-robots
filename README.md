# SLAM-or-object-detection-for-robots
 In this project,  SLAM for robot that moves and senses in a 2 dimensional, grid world!  SLAM gives us a way to both localize a robot and build up a map of its environment as a robot moves and senses in real-time. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems. Since this localization and map-building relies on the visual sensing of landmarks, this is a computer vision problem.
